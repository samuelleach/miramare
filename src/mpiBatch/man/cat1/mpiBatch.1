	  This is a MPI	utility	that will read a list of shell
	  commands and execute each command on a different processor.
	  The list of shell commands is	given to the program by	way of
	  the _c_m_d_F_i_l_e. Each MPI	task will invoke a shell and execute a
	  unique line in the command file.  Empty lines, and lines
	  which	begin with the character "#" will be ignored.  If
	  there	are more commands than MPI tasks, then only the	first
	  commands will	be executed. If	there are fewer	commands than
	  MPI tasks the	some processors	will be	idle.

	  It is	important to note, that	for proper load	balancing each
	  command in the file should take approximately	the same
	  amount of execution time, as none of the CPU resources will
	  be freed up until all	of the tasks have completed.

	  The standard output of each of the tasks is piped to a file
	  which	has the	following naming convention:
	  _c_m_d_F_i_l_e__t_a_s_k_I_D._l_o_g where _c_m_d_F_i_l_e is the name of the command
	  file,	and taskID is the rank of the MPI task which executes
	  the comand.
